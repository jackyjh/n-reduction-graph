![The process to construct the n-reduced graph](Fig1.png)

Overview of n-reduced graph: the n-reduced graph is an approximated representation of the original hypergraph
that consists of hyperedges of orders no greater than n, with the goal of minimizing information loss,
which is particularly suitable for evaluating the role of hyperedges with orders larger than a threshold.
